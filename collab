## Narrative/copy Writing Guidelines

### Language Standards
- Use objective, professional language in all reports
- Avoid inflammatory descriptors like "awful", "terrible", "emergency", "crisis", "disaster"
- Avoid inflammatory terms like "viral copyleft" (use "strong copyleft" instead)
- Use measured risk terminology: Low, Moderate, High, Critical
- Avoid emojis in professional documentation (exception: checkmarks in success criteria lists are acceptable)
- Use factual, evidence-based descriptions of security issues
- Frame challenges as opportunities for improvement rather than failures


## Markdown Formatting Rules

### Bold Headers with Lists
When using bold text as a section header followed by a bulleted list, ALWAYS include a blank line between the bold header and the list for proper Markdown rendering.

**Correct Format:**
```markdown
**Section Header:**

- First bullet point
- Second bullet point
```

**Incorrect Format:**
```markdown
**Section Header:**
- First bullet point
- Second bullet point
```

## Text Formatting Requirements

- **ALWAYS wrap at 120 characters maximum**: When showing diffs, proposed changes, current/new text comparisons, or any code examples, ensure all lines are wrapped at 120 characters or less
- **Use consistent line breaking**: Break lines at natural points (spaces, punctuation) when possible
- **Maintain readability**: Ensure wrapped content remains easy to read and understand
- **Apply to all text presentations**: This applies to search_replace previews, proposed changes, current vs proposed text, diffs, and any code examples shown to the user

## YAML Syntax Validation

**MANDATORY**: When editing YAML files or embedded YAML content (e.g., in HTML files), always validate YAML syntax after making changes.

### Validation Requirements:
- After editing YAML files, run `python3 -c "import yaml; yaml.safe_load(open('path/to/file.yaml'))"` to validate syntax
- For embedded YAML in HTML files, extract and validate the YAML content
- Fix any YAML syntax errors immediately before proceeding with other changes
- Common YAML errors to watch for:
  - Incorrect indentation (must use consistent spaces, typically 2 spaces)
  - Missing colons after keys
  - Unquoted strings with special characters
  - Duplicate keys in the same scope
  - Incorrect list formatting
  - Unclosed quotes or brackets

## Shell Command Guidelines

### Command Structure
- Keep shell commands simple and single-purpose
- Avoid complex multi-line echo statements in single commands
- Use separate commands for separate actions
- Prefer simple output over complex formatting

### Avoid These Patterns
```bash
# DON'T: Complex multi-line echo in single command
echo "line1" && echo "line2" && echo "line3"

# DON'T: Long commands with multiple echo statements
python3 tool.py && echo "result:" && echo "details..."
```

### Use These Patterns Instead
```bash
# DO: Simple, focused commands
echo "Starting process..."
python3 tool.py
echo "Process complete"

# DO: Break complex output into separate commands
echo "Step 1: Initialize"
echo "Step 2: Execute"
echo "Step 3: Complete"


### File Operations
- Read files before editing when possible
- Use search_replace for targeted changes
- Prefer MultiEdit for multiple changes to same file
- Always check file exists before operations

## Code Quality
- Keep functions focused and single-purpose
- Use clear variable names
- Add proper error handling
- Include helpful logging messages
- Avoid complex nested operations
